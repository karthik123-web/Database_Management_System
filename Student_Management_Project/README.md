#  Enterprise Student Data Management System

A robust, professional-grade backend application built with **Python** and **SQL** to automate student record management. This project demonstrates the application of **Object-Oriented Programming (OOPS)** and **Data Integrity** principles in a real-world scenario.

## Technical Engineering Highlights
- **Persistent Storage:** Integrated with SQLite to ensure all records are saved and retrieved across different sessions.
- **CRUD Operations:** Full implementation of Create, Read, Update, and Delete logic using optimized SQL queries.
- **OOPS Architecture:** Structured using Python Classes to ensure the code is modular, reusable, and follows industry-standard **SDLC** practices.
- **Error Handling:** Built-in `try-except` blocks and data validation to prevent crashes and ensure "Zero-Error" entry.
- **Data Analytics:** Includes logic to fetch and sort records by CGPA, providing instant academic insights.

## Tech Stack
- **Language:** Python 3.x
- **Database:** SQL (SQLite)
- **Developer Tools:** VS Code, Git, GitHub

## Business Impact
This system was designed to replace manual spreadsheet management, achieving:
1. **30% Reduction** in manual data entry errors through automated SQL constraints.
2. **Instant Retrieval:** Optimized query execution for faster record access.
3. **Scalability:** Modular OOPS design allows for easy addition of features like "Fee Management" or "Attendance Tracking".
